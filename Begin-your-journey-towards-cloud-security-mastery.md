# How do you begin your journey towards mastering cloud security?

A successful cloud security professional and cloud guru once told me, you learn 3 things:

“How it works, how to break it, how to fix it, and in doing these you learn how to protect it”.

So where to begin?

## Step 1) - Apply the above principle to the cloud admin console.

The cloud admin console, accessed either through a web user interface (UI) with credentials, or a command line interface (CLI) with keys, acts as the control plane, allowing users to interact with and manage cloud resources in a centralized location.

It plays a pivotal role in provisioning, configuring, deploying, monitoring, and securing cloud-based services. The admin console introduces a new and intricate attack surface beyond the scope of conventional networks that requires a deep technical understanding and knowledge in order to secure correctly.

Where should you go to obtain this knowledge?

## Step 2) - Go directly to cloud providers for hands-on technical practice in a playground where you can learn firsthand how it works, how to break it, and how to fix it.

What’s even better, is that anyone can access it, and anyone can start with the FREE user credits provided.

There are no excuses why you cannot take steps towards becoming a cloud security master today.

Pick a provider of your choice and get after it:

For AWS, access the AWS Management Console
[FREE] Account signup - https://lnkd.in/eaaPCX6d


For Azure, access the Microsoft Azure Portal
[FREE] Account signup - https://lnkd.in/eDf5FM3C

For GCP, access the Google Cloud Console.
[FREE] Account signup - https://lnkd.in/e6dUnh7a

## Step 3) - Once inside, play with and provision services. Pick a side project that requires cloud resources and try your hand at configuring it correctly. Get it working, break it to pieces, reconfigure it, and search for secure best practices and implement the changes.

Need a nudge towards some intentionally vulnerable and broken services to exploit?

I’ve got you covered:

## Step 4) - Provision labs that are insecure by design, and have some fun exploiting them. Use your new user account credits to spin these up for free. \
